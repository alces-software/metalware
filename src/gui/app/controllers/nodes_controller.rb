    # separate process rather than having the current Rails process be replaced
    # (which would be bad). It also doesn't give an indication (apart from by
    # parsing its output) of whether the command failed, e.g. a non-zero in
    # this case, so just display the output as a generic notice for now.
    # XXX Improve the power command and hence this action; running the command
    # can also be very slow so may be better way to run this than within single
    # HTTP request.
