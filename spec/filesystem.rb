    # This module contains all methods to be called on a FileSystem to set up
    # the underlying FakeFS. All methods are appropriately delegated here, so
    # these can be called on a `FileSystemConfigurator` instance and will then
    # be correctly invoked when `FileSystem.test` is run with that instance.
    # This module is necessary as if any of the original methods were run
    # directly outside of a `test` block then the real file system would be
    # used.

  # `FileSystem#test` in the usual way but any cached `FileSystem` method calls
  # will be executed prior to yielding the setup `FileSystem` to the
  # user-passed block.
  #
  # Since there is a single global `FakeFS`, this has an advantage over running
  # method calls to set this up directly as it prevents it from being in an
  # inconsistent state, as well as ensuring the `FakeFS` is used only while the
  # `FakeFS do` block is executing in `test`.
  #
  # XXX This has the disadvantage that for calls which fail the exception is
  # not thrown from where the actual failing call is made; it could be worth
  # actually running the methods to check this, and then replaying them afresh
